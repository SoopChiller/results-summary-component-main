## My process
I really got lost in the CSS sauce on this project!

This is by far the most challenging clone I've done thus far.

I wanted to see where I was at with my understanding of HTML & CSS

Long ways to go!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned about overlapping my divs

Creating nice box-shadows

Linear-gradients


### Continued development

In my continued development I'll continue to focus on my organization and semantic HTML

Responsive designs

Thanks for reading. happy coding!
